// After becoming famous, the CodeBots decided to move into a new building together. 
// Each of the rooms has a different cost, and some of them are free, but there's a rumour that all the free rooms are haunted! 
// Since the CodeBots are quite superstitious, they refuse to stay in any of the free rooms, or any of the rooms below any of the free rooms.

// Given matrix, a rectangular matrix of integers, where each value represents the cost of the room, 
// your task is to return the total sum of all rooms that are suitable for the CodeBots (ie: add up all the values that don't appear below a 0)..
